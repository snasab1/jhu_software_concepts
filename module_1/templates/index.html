            <section>
  <p>My name is Sara Nasab, and I'm a Senior Systems Engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. I grew up in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, spent several years earning my PhD in Santa Cruz, California, and now live and work in Baltimore.</p>

  <p>I've become increasingly interested in data science because of its powerful blend of statistics, analysis, and creative problem-solvingâ€”it offers the ability to extract meaningful answers from any kind of data. I see data science as a key to staying relevant in a rapidly evolving industry and as a pathway to new professional opportunities.</p>

  <p>I have a deep love for Spanish language and culture. Despite my graduate degrees being in Math, I majored in Spanish as an undergrad. I've visited Spain twice in the past two years, spent time in Buenos Aires, and dream of living in a Spanish-speaking country for a year. I'm also known among friends and family for making a mean batch of alfajores de maicena!</p>
