## Project Overview
**Using data from Module 3 (see README for the context of that assignment and running instructions), I improved my code using Pylint until I achieved 10/10 (linted code did not have any error messages). I also incorporated SQL Injection Defenses as specified by the assignment. Finally, I visually analyzed at my module dependencies using pydeps and graphviz.**
