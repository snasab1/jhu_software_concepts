The pydeps diagram visually represents how Flask and Python are interacting with one another. It shows that the app.py file directly depends on the flask library and on query_data.py. We also see that query_data.py relies on the psycopg to connect to PostgreSQL in order to create SQL queries. The various flask. nodes illustrate the internal modularity of the Flask framework itself. Overall, it's a visual map of what each part of the code needs from other parts to work.
